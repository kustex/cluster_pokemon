# cluster_pokemon

In this repository you can find a jupyter notebook with some drills I had to solve during the AI/Data Science bootcamp @becode.org.  
This topic was all about clustering for unsupervised ML-algorithms. 

The graphs are created with the Plotly library. They are not shown because Github doesn't support iframes. If you copy the link inside https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ you will be able to see them.
