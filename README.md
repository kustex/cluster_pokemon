# Cluster Pokemon
<ol>
In this repository you can find a jupyter notebook with some drills I had to solve during the AI/Data Science bootcamp at BeCode.org.  
This topic was all about clustering for unsupervised ML-algorithms. 
<br>
The graphs are created with the Plotly library. They are not shown because Github doesn't support iframes.
